/* Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.

Compound assignment operators combine an arithmetic operation with assignment, making your code cleaner and more concise. Instead of writing x = x + 2, you can simply write x += 2. */
