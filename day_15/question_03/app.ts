// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

        Manufacturer,
        Model
    }
    for (let [key, value] of propertiesAndFeatures) {
        carsProperties[key] = value;
    }
    return carsProperties;
}
//Invoking function:
